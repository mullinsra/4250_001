Take in a string (from a user or a file), compute the total number of occurrences of each character in the ASCII set. 
Print out the top three characters (with the most occurrences). Print out how many characters in the ASCII set you didn’t detect. 
Then print out the string in reverse order.
Methods:

// The method that will take the user input. It will need to take the string from the user then. It will test 
//that string to make sure that the string entered will be over three characters and three distinct 
//characters so that the program will be able to print the top three characters with the most                          
// occurrences.

UserInput:
While:
Print(“Please a string that is at least 3 characters along and those characters be distinct from one another.”)
If the string is smaller than 3 characters
If the string doesn’t have three distinct characters
Else Accept the user input then run

// TotalOccurences: The total occurrences will take the string from the user and break it down then sort 
// the occurrences by how many each occurrences happened. When it has the list of the occurrences it 
// will take the three most occurrences and print those out.

TotalOccurences:
Takes UserInput
Converts UserInput into a TotalOccurences
Sorts TotalOccurences into the high to low of the amount of the occurences
Gets the top three occurrences and puts into list TopThree
Prints TopThree

//ASCIMissing: This method will need to use the TotalOccurences to get all of the occurrences from the 
// string and then compare that list from TotalOccurences to a list of all the ACSII characters. Once it            
// gets the list of missing ASCI characters it will print the ASCIMissing list.
	
ASCIMissing:

//StringReverse: This method will take the UserInput string and then reverse it.
StringReverse:

Unit Testing

UserInput:
//The Unit testing for the UserInput method would test to see if the user entered the required length 
//and make sure they are distinct. It would make sure it doesn’t take a null as a input either. It will test 
//to make sure that all characters entered would be printable by the program.

TotallOccurences:
// TotalOccurences:  Will need to test to see what happens when there are more then top 3 characters 
// have the same number of characters. If that happens, have it display the extra ASCI characters next to 
// each other on the print list for the top three characters

ASCIMissing:
// ASCIMissing:
